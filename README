SprocketFulfillment
===================

This plugin allows you to add Sprocket Express (www.sprocketexpress.com) order 
fulfillment to your e-commerce store (or whatever.)  

Sprocket Express (in their infinite antiquity) requires that you push a CSV 
file every day to their FTP server with details of the items you want to be 
shipped. So the plugin stores "SprocketFulfillmentOrders" in the db (along 
with all the attributes required by Sprocket Express).  You can then use the 
built-in rake task to generate the proper CSV file and then upload it to the 
Sprocket Express FTP server (a cron job is probably in order) each night.


Example
=======

Setup steps:
1. Create a new migration using script/generate sprocket_fulfillment_migrations

2. Create new order as defined below, and add some 
sprocket_fullfillment_order_line_items
to it.  You can assign any of the attributes defined in 
SprocketFulfillment::Map::MAPPING


Usage
---------
@order = SprocketFulfillmentOrder.create( 
           :first_name => 'Richard',
           :last_name  => 'Dawkins',
           :sales_id   => 'AMZ',
           :address_1  => "11 Park Place",
           :city       => "New York",
           :country    => SprocketFulfillment::Map.get_country_code("United States"),
           :state      => 'NY',
           :zipcode    => '10007',
           :ship_via   => SprocketFulfillment::Map.get_carrier_code('USPS Express Mail') 
         )

@order.sprocket_products << SprocketProduct.new(:product => "370", 
                                                :quantity => 43, 
                                                :price => 37.00)

3. Create the CSV file by calling create_order_file_for on SprocketfulfillmentOrder 
class with arguments like start_time and end_time. 
eg. filename = SprocketFulfillmentOrder.create_order_file_for(Time.now.yesterday)
filename is the location of newly generated file
