SprocketFulfillment
===================

This plugin allows you to add Sprocket Express (www.sprocketexpress.com) order 
fulfillment to your e-commerce store (or whatever.)  

Sprocket Express (in  their infinite antiquity) requires that you push a CSV 
file every day to their FTP server with details of the items you want to be 
shipped. So the plugin stores "SprocketFulfillmentOrders" in the db (along 
with all the attributes required by Sprocket Express).  You can then use the 
built-in rake task to generate the proper CSV file and then upload it to the 
Sprocket Express FTP server (a cron job is probably in order.)


Example
=======

Setup steps:
1. Create a new migration . 
2. Copy the content of create_sprocket_tables.rb file to that migration.
3. Create new order as defined below. and add sprocket_products to this order

Usage. 
You can assign any of the attributes defined in SprocketFulfillment::Map::MAPPING
@order = SprocketFulfillmentOrder.create( 
           :first_name => "Dan" ,
           :last_name => 'Brown',
           :sales_id =>'ASD',
           :address_1 => "621, Some Lane",
           :city => "Newyork",
           :country => SprocketFulfillment::Map.get_country_code("United States"),
           :state =>'NY',
           :zipcode=>'10013',
           :ship_via => SprocketFulfillment::Map.get_carrier_code('USPS Express Mail') 
         )

@order.sprocket_products << SprocketProduct.new(:product => "Da Vinci Code", 
                                                :quantity => 2, 
                                                :price => 23.00)

4. Create CSV file by calling create_order_file_for on SprocketfulfillmentOrder 
class with arguments like start_time and end_time. 
eg. filename = SprocketFulfillmentOrder.create_order_file_for(Time.now.yesterday)
filename is the location of newly generated file
