Description:
    The sprocket express order generator creates a migration for the Rails project to store
    orders (and all their attributes) in the db, which is required (rather than sending directly 
    to the API) because *there is no real-time API*.  Sprocket Express requires pushing daily
    order summary CSVs to its FTP server nightly.

Example:
    ./script/generate sprocket_migration [migration_filename]

    This will create a new migration called CreateSprocketExpressTables and thus the tables
    sprocket_express_orders and sprocket_express_order_line_items.
